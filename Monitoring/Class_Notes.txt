				Production Servers ==> 
				
					Servers will be monitored for CPU/Memory Utilization / Traffic
					
							75% of CPU/Memory Utilization 
							Notify the user
					
					Monitoring Tools : 	Prometheus/Nagios/Dynatrace
										Grafana ==> Visualization Tool										
										
				Completely Owned by the Production Support / Monitoring Team.
				
				
				Jenkins_Master_Node
				
					Jenkins_Slave_Nodes			# Build --> clone the repos/create artifacts
				
		--> Application Monitoring 
					AppDynamics/DataDog 
		
				Application Code 
		
		Prometheus/Grafana ::
		
			- Architecture
					Client/Server Architecture
			- Agents 
			- Database - Timeseries Database 			
					- PromQL
				
				
		Working with Prometheus/Grafana ::
		
			Install Prometheus/
			 Run it as a service 
			 
			
			VM1 --> Monitoring Server - Prometheus 
			
			VM2 --> Target Server 
			
			Integrate Prometheus with Grafana to create Dashboards			 
			 
			Node Exporter should be installed in target nodes.
